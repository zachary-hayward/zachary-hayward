# Welcome to My GitHub Profile

Hi, I'm Zac. I'm a developer with a passion for creating projects that better my life, and hopefully others too. Here you can find an overview of my most recent work in a bootcamp through Dev Academy Aotearoa.

## About Me

- I have a Bachelors in Math and Education.
- Recent bootcamp focusing on JS, React, Express, SQLite3 through Dev Academy Aotearoa.
- I dabbled with lua since I was a teen, loved the analytical problem solving side of things. Didn't want to live in tiny cubicle though.
- Found out the steriotype is completely off point, am highly enthusiastic and engaged with coding now.
- Iâ€™m currently really delving into React. It seems useful, super useful.
- I have personal project that should deployed and usable by me, and the world! Very soon. MVP is complete, just getting my hands on a suitable domain and SSL cert.
